Smart Water Dispener

## Description

Since the world of the internet is moving towards smart cities and smart
homes. Where everything is interconnected via the internet or some
smartness or a combination of sensors and actuators and with the
progress of the internet and Ai. It is not surprising to say that about 5 to 10
years from now at least if not a smart home everyone around the globe will
be using some fruits of the Internet of things (IOT) in the form of some
gadgets to make their life more easier and comfortable.
In this semester project on the subject of Internet of things (IOT) we have
tried to contribute a little bit in the field of Internet of thing (IOT) by
implementing a smart water dispenser. In this day and age we often see a
water dispenser in malls, offices, factories, mills, homes or even in public
places. A common problem which almost every owner of water dispensers
faces is due to continuous pressure on buttons or tap of
cold and hot water often gets hard, stuck or damaged and the owner has
to frequently get taps replaced which creates a headache to the owner.
So the idea is to design and develop a prototype of a water dispenser with
some smartness using concepts of the internet of things. We have
implemented using a sensor and arduino a smart water dispenser where
no tap is needed to get water when glass is brought below the point where
water can be poured it automatically starts flowing and when glass is
displaced from the point of flow it automatically stops flowing.
